# Si-Nb-Si-glass
Project for using SESSA program like core-calculator of theoretical XPS-spectra in minimization procedure to build a multilayer structures.
This project was started when I had a problem with build a structure fro the known experimental spectra. 
Unfortunately SESSA v2 doesn't have pure CLI (no-gui) version and I wrote a special wrapper on C and python to call SESSA calculator for each automatically created input file.
