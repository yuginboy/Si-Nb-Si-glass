# Si-Nb-Si-glass
Project for using SESSA program like core-calculator of theoretical XPS-spectra in minimization procedure to build a multilayer structures.
This project was started when I had a problem with build (reconstruct) a structure for the known experimental spectra (inverse problem).
Unfortunately SESSA v2 doesn't have pure CLI (no-gui) version and I wrote a special wrapper on C and python to call SESSA calculator for each automatically created input file.
This program was tested only on GNU Linux OS together with a Wine program and Anaconda3-4.2.0.
